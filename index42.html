    <h1>Hujambo, I am Obed ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>My name is Obed Nyangena, a passionate economist, data and policy advisor dedicated to making economics accessible and impactful for everyone. Currently I serve as Principal Planning Officer at the National Mining Corporation, and I am an active member of both the Economists Society of Kenya (ESK) and the International Society for Development and Sustainability.</p>
    <p>My journey into economics began at the University of Nairobi, Kenya, way back in 2010, where I discovered my fascination with data, policy and the power of research to shape real-world outcomes amid uncertainty. Since then, I have worked across government, academia and consultancy, helping organizations and individuals mold and shape data-driven insights to detect and harness opportunities, deter and solve complex challenges in economic development, climate change, security, health and public policy.</p>
    <p>I created this platform with a strong conviction that lessons learnt over the years can have a forceful multiplier effect and help have a better world to live in- whether it is generating and simplifying economic data, guiding research or offering practical policy advice - so that others can build their own expertise and drive positive change in their organizations and communities.</p>
    <p>Reach out for incisive and metricized ideas in economics, strategy or policy research. Be rest assured that I will guide you to not only understand how data can make a difference but also customize products that can drive the growth you so much desire.</p>
